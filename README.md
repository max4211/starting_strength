regressing across a series of lifts parameterized by current weight and progress, extrapolates out milestones

### improvements
- dynamically bound size of graph to milestones
- generate interactive UI (web based?)
- kinks in progress estimates
- interconvert between lbs/kgs
- compute 1RM and other rep ranges
- include milestones in label
